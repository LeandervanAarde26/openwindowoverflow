            This is how the components could be structured in order to find them easier throughout the process
            Components use the .component extenston and styles use .styles. 
            Components are broken up into seperate Folders with a .jsx file and a .scss file PER COMPONENT
            Please message me or Vian if you are confused about how the structure works.
